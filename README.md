# CS-330_Portfolio

1.	How do I approach designing software?
o	What new design skills has your work on the project helped you to craft?
o	What design process did you follow for your project work?
o	How could tactics from your design approach be applied in future work?
2.	How do I approach developing programs?
o	What new development strategies did you use while working on your 3D scene?
o	How did iteration factor into your development?
o	How has your approach to developing code evolved throughout the milestones, which led you to the project’s completion?
3.	How can computer science help me in reaching my goals?
o	How do computational graphics and visualizations give you new knowledge and skills that can be applied in your future educational pathway?
o	How do computational graphics and visualizations give you new knowledge and skills that can be applied in your future professional pathway?

When I started this term, I did not have any experience in design. Everything that I’ve learned was new to me. Building my project helped me learn a lot of new skills. To learn those skills I followed the design process that was provided to us throughout the course. We started from basics and progressed to creating our 3D scene. I believe, if I’ll have to work with OpenGL in the future, I’ll be able to use my learned tactics to help me on the project. 
Thinking about development strategies, I believe I’ve already used them in my previous courses. Although, my approach to developing code throughout the milestones helped me out with my final project completion. I was able to work on each section at the time. I build my 3D shapes, camera movements, texturing, lighting, etc. I made it easier rather than working on the whole project at the same time. 
I had an interest in computer science for a while now. My computation graphics and visualization give me more skills and knowledge that I can apply to my future education and/or professional life. It gives me more leverage to get a better career as well. It helps me grasp more knowledge and be prepared for the next challenging course. In professional life, it helps me to have better background if I’ll be applying for a different position that requires design or any other computer science skills.
